# regress-Euler-angles-by-gradient-descent
this is used for computer eruler angles by the 68 3D landmarks of face.
You should provide the 3D position of 68 landmarks and a standard face used for compute.
I use a binary search method to regress angles.Just like rotate a standard face to fit your test face.
